NAME
    Apache2::ShowStatus - if you want to know what your Apache processes are
    doing

SYNOPSIS
     LoadModule perl_module ".../mod_perl.so"
     PerlModule Apache2::ShowStatus
     PerlInitHandler Apache2::ShowStatus

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a "PerlInitHandler" that sets the apache's process
    title to

     "httpd: ".$r->the_request

    The process title is automagically reset when the request is over.

    Thus, "top" & Co shows what requests are currently active.
